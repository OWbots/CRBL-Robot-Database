It was a completely revamped design, upgraded electronics, improved drive, and an innovative new weapon system design. This new generation design was a home run, knocking out multiple bots in a matter of seconds. V2.0, the most recent version, shared the same internal framework and electronics as the original, but with more completed armor plating, a better gear ratio in the drive, and better guide wheels on the top of the bot.",
