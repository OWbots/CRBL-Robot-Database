It was a completely revamped design, upgraded electronics, improved drive, and an innovative new weapon system design. This new generation design was a home run, knocking out multiple bots in a matter of seconds. V2.0, the most recent version, shared the same internal framework and electronics as the original, but with more completed armor plating, a better gear ratio in the drive, and better guide wheels on the top of the bot.",

                description: "Catastrophe is a 4wd vertical spinner I designed in September 2023. It is heavily inspired by the heavyweight battlebot Endgame and it is by far my most successful design. Originally designed to take down big and unstable spinners like Drumroll, Catastrophe has gone through many upgrades and has beaten some of the best robots in the world. Even though Catastrophe is heavily outgunned in most of its matchups it still finds a way to put up a dominant performance and has proved that the jack of all trades single battery type robots can still survive in a world that is quickly evolving towards the dual battery meta.",
